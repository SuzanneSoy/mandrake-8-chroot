Cons:
GColorChooser became better
Charmap became better (but by far not perfect)
utf-8 support was not quite there yet
Cannot drag and drop a window using the miniature in the pager
su was a pain (quoting and always typing the password), sudo is better
the configuration menus were sometims a bit disorganised, and spread across several "control centers" (Mandrake's, KDE's, ...)

Pros:
kioslaves allowed to view man pages and info pages with hyperlinks and decent formatting
arts-builder (nice & fun synthesizer)
lots of configuration menus
